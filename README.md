# hello-world
A humble repository

Hi there,

I hope this is going to be a great year full of commits. Looking forward to python, R, SQL and maybe even some javascript down the track. Who knows, it'll be an exciting time..Data Science here I come!

Update 28 Nov 2019:

I am currently doing statistics with R. This includes statistics and probability, inference, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing and creating project reports with rmarkdown.

While I am learning new things and advancing my Data Science portfolio, I will start working on creating my own website!
